# Notes

This delicious French spice bread is best enjoyed the next day when the flavours have had time to develop. It keeps well wrapped in foil for up to a week. The spice mix typically includes cinnamon, green aniseed, star anise, nutmeg, coriander seeds, cloves and ground ginger, but you can also use a pre-made pain d'épices spice blend if available.

# Ingredients

## Fridge
- 250ml (1 cup) milk

## Pantry
- 125g (3/4 cup) brown sugar
- 250g (1-3/4 cups) flour
- 3 tbsp honey
- 3 tsp baking soda (Natron)
- 3 tsp orange blossom water

## Spices
- 2 tsp spice mix (cinnamon, green aniseed, star anise, grated nutmeg, coriander seeds, cloves, ground ginger)

# Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (160°C fan).
2. In a large bowl, mix together {brown sugar}, {flour}, {honey}, {baking soda}, {orange blossom water}, {spice mix}, and {milk} until well combined and smooth.
3. Pour the batter into a greased rectangular baking tin (about 20cm x 10cm).
4. Bake for 45 minutes, or until a skewer inserted into the center comes out clean.
5. Let cool in the tin for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely.

# Serving Suggestions

Slice and enjoy with butter, or serve with tea or coffee. Even better the next day when the flavours have mellowed and the texture becomes more moist. Store wrapped in foil to keep fresh.
