# Notes

Keep the margarine cold – this helps create a flaky texture. Don't overwork the dough, just bring it together gently. Best eaten fresh on the day, but they freeze well too. Just defrost at room temperature and reheat in a hot oven for a few minutes.

# Ingredients

## Fridge
- 55g plant-based block margarine, cold
- 150ml plant milk (oat or soy work best)
- A little extra plant milk for glazing

## Spices
- Pinch of salt

## Pantry
- 225g plain flour (Type 405)
- 3 tsp baking powder
- 25g caster sugar

# Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 220°C / 200°C fan / Gas 7 and lightly grease a large baking tray.
2. Whisk together {flour}, {baking powder}, and {salt} so the raising agent is evenly distributed.
3. Using your fingertips, rub the cold {margarine} into the {flour} until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs.
4. Stir in {sugar}. Add most of the {plant milk} and mix to form a soft and slightly sticky dough. If it's a little dry, add more {milk} until you get the right consistency.
5. Turn out onto a floured work surface and knead very lightly. Pat out into a round about 2cm thick.
6. Use a 5cm cutter to stamp out rounds and place on the baking tray. Lightly knead together any remaining dough and stamp out more scones to use it all up.
7. Brush the tops with a little {plant milk}.
8. Bake for 12-15 minutes until well risen and golden.
9. Cool on a wire rack. Serve with jam and vegan butter, or vegan whipped cream if you're feeling fancy!

# Serving Suggestions

Serve warm with jam and vegan butter. For a traditional cream tea, add vegan whipped cream. Try adding dried fruit or a pinch of cinnamon to the dough for a twist.
