# Notes

Keep the margarine cold – this helps create a flaky texture. Don't overwork the dough, just bring it together gently. Best eaten fresh on the day, but they freeze well too. Just defrost at room temperature and reheat in a hot oven for a few minutes.

# Ingredients

## Fridge

- 55 g plant-based block margarine, cold
- 150 ml plant milk for the dough
- A splash of plant milk for brushing

## Spices

- Pinch of salt

## Pantry

- 225 g plain flour (T45 / Type 405 / Tipo 00)
- 3 tsp baking powder
- 25 g caster sugar

# Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 220°C / 200°C fan / Gas 7 and lightly grease a large baking tray.
2. Whisk together {flour}, {baking powder}, and {salt} so the raising agent is evenly distributed.
3. Using your fingertips, rub the cold {margarine} into the {flour} until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs.
4. Stir in {sugar}. Add most of the {plant milk for the dough} and mix to form a soft and slightly sticky dough. If it's a little dry, add more milk until you get the right consistency.
5. Turn out onto a floured work surface and knead very lightly. Pat out into a round about 2cm thick.
6. Use a 5cm cutter to stamp out rounds and place on the baking tray. Lightly knead together any remaining dough and stamp out more scones to use it all up.
7. Brush the tops with a little {plant milk for brushing}.
8. Bake for 12-15 minutes until well risen and golden.
9. Cool on a wire rack. Serve with jam and vegan butter, or vegan whipped cream if you're feeling fancy!

# Serving Suggestions

Serve warm with jam and vegan butter. For a traditional cream tea, add vegan whipped cream. Try adding dried fruit or a pinch of cinnamon to the dough for a twist.
