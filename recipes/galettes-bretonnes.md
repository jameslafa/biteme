# Notes

The batter needs at least 2 hours of resting in the fridge, ideally overnight — plan ahead. The first galette is almost always a throwaway (la galette de test!) so don't worry about it. Good buckwheat flour is key — look for farine de sarrasin or blé noir. Stack cooked galettes under a tea towel to keep them warm and pliable. Leftovers keep well in the fridge for 2–3 days; reheat in a dry pan.

# Ingredients

## Fresh

- 200 g mixed mushrooms (chestnut, oyster, or shiitake), sliced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- Fresh thyme, a few sprigs
- Fresh parsley, chopped

## Pantry

- 250 g buckwheat flour
- 500-750 ml water
- 5 g fine salt
- 1 tbsp vegetable oil (e.g. rapeseed, sunflower, canola)
- 1 tbsp soy sauce

# Instructions

1. Sift the {buckwheat flour} into a large bowl and add the {salt}. Gradually pour in the {water} while whisking continuously until the batter is smooth and thin, like single cream. Cover and rest in the fridge for at least 2 hours, ideally overnight.
2. When ready to cook, check the batter consistency and add a splash of water if needed.
3. Heat a drizzle of {oil} in a pan over medium heat. Add the {mushrooms} and cook for 5 minutes until golden. Add the {garlic} and {thyme}, cook for another minute, then add the {soy sauce}. Stir and set aside.
4. Heat a large flat pan over medium-high heat. Lightly grease with {oil}.
5. Pour a ladleful of batter and quickly spread it as thinly as possible.
6. Cook for about 2 minutes until the edges lift and turn crispy. Flip and cook for 1 more minute.
7. Spoon the mushroom filling onto the galette, fold the edges in, sprinkle with fresh {parsley}, and serve immediately.

# Serving Suggestions

Serve with a bowl of cidre breton for the full Breton experience. Other vegan filling ideas: creamy leeks with oat cream and nutmeg; ratatouille; caramelised onion and spinach with vegan cheese; roasted butternut squash with cumin, hummus, and toasted pumpkin seeds; or vegan pesto with sun-dried tomatoes, pine nuts, and rocket.

For vegetarian fillings: a fried egg with grated Comté (the classic complète); goat cheese with honey and walnuts; sautéed mushrooms with egg and Gruyère; or wilted spinach with ricotta, lemon zest, and black pepper.
