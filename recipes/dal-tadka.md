# Notes

Red lentils break down into a creamy texture, yellow lentils hold their shape a bit more — both work well. Lentils are easy to find in any German supermarket or Asian shop.

# Ingredients

## Fresh

- 1 onion, finely diced
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 thumb fresh ginger, grated
- Lemon for juice

## Pantry

- 250 g red or yellow lentils
- 1 tin (400 g) chopped tomatoes
- 1 tbsp vegetable oil (e.g. rapeseed, sunflower, canola)

## Spices

- 1 tsp cumin seeds
- 1 tsp turmeric
- 1 tsp garam masala
- Chilli to taste
- Salt to taste

# Instructions

1. Rinse {lentils} and cook in water until soft, about 15 minutes. Drain any excess water.
2. In a pan, heat {oil} and fry the {cumin seeds} until they start to pop, then add {onion} and cook until golden.
3. Add {garlic}, {ginger}, {turmeric}, {garam masala} and {chilli}. Cook for 2 minutes, stirring often.
4. Add the {tomatoes} and cook for 5 minutes.
5. Stir in the cooked lentils and simmer together for 10 minutes.

# Serving Suggestions

Serve with basmati rice or naan bread. A dollop of coconut yoghurt and fresh coriander on top works nicely.
