# Notes

Use warm chickpeas, as they're softer and easier to blend. The ice cubes are not optional! The cold shock against the warm chickpeas aerates the hummus beautifully. Don't add olive oil to the base mixture. The tahini has plenty of fat. Olive oil goes on top when serving. The hummus keeps well in the fridge for up to 3 days.

# Ingredients

## Fresh
- 1 clove garlic, crushed
- Juice of 1 lemon

## Fridge
- Ice cubes (about 25g)

## Spices
- Salt to taste
- Optional: pinch of cumin, paprika, sumac, or za'atar

## Pantry
- 250g dried chickpeas
- 1 tsp bicarbonate of soda (for soaking)
- 1 tsp bicarbonate of soda (for cooking)
- 120g tahini (or more to taste)
- Good quality olive oil (for serving)

# Instructions

1. Soak {chickpeas} overnight in plenty of water with 1 teaspoon of {bicarbonate of soda}.
2. Drain and rinse the {chickpeas}. Place them in a pan with the second teaspoon of {bicarbonate of soda} and cook on medium heat for a few minutes. Add enough water to cover them by a few centimeters, bring to a boil, and cook for 20 to 40 minutes until they're really soft with no bite at all. Skim off any foam and loose skins as they cook.
3. Drain {chickpeas} over a bowl, saving the cooking water.
4. While the {chickpeas} are still warm, put them into a food processor with {tahini}, {garlic}, {lemon} juice, {ice cubes}, 2 tablespoons of the reserved chickpea water, and a good pinch of {salt}.
5. Blitz until smooth, then taste and adjust. You might need more {tahini}, {garlic}, {lemon}, {salt}, or chickpea water. Don't be shy about adding more {tahini}. Blitz for a few minutes at least until it's really smooth and creamy.
6. Transfer to a bowl, cover the surface with cling film, and let it rest for at least 30 minutes.
7. Serve drizzled with good {olive oil} and a squeeze of {lemon}. Optionally sprinkle with {cumin}, {paprika}, {sumac}, or {za'atar} for extra flavour.

# Serving Suggestions

Drizzle with your best olive oil and add a squeeze of fresh lemon. Sprinkle with cumin, paprika, sumac, or za'atar. Serve with warm pita bread, fresh vegetables, or use as a sandwich spread. For the tahini, Al Arz is a great brand that's not too bitter.
