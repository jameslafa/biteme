# Notes

The cocoa powder adds a lovely depth without making it taste chocolatey. Add the chilli powder gradually and taste as you go if you're not sure about heat levels. For a smoky twist, add a finely chopped chipotle pepper or a teaspoon of chipotle paste.
 Freezes brilliantly in portions for easy weeknight dinners.
