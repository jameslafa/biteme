# Notes

Use very ripe bananas with lots of brown spots for the best flavour and natural sweetness. The banana bread keeps well wrapped in foil for 3-4 days at room temperature, or can be frozen for up to 3 months. For extra indulgence, fold in some chocolate chips or chopped walnuts before baking.

# Ingredients

## Fresh
- 4 medium ripe bananas, mashed
- Extra banana slices for topping

## Fridge
- 60 ml unsweetened plant milk

## Pantry
- 100 g light brown sugar
- 250 g all-purpose flour
- 60 ml vegetable oil
- 2 tsp pure vanilla extract
- 1 tsp baking soda

## Spices
- 1 tsp cinnamon
- 1/2 tsp salt

# Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (160°C fan). Spray a 9×5 inch (23×13cm) loaf pan with nonstick spray, then dust with flour.
2. In a large mixing bowl, roughly mash {bananas}. Add {light brown sugar}, {oil}, {vanilla}, and {unsweetened plant milk}, and whisk to incorporate.
3. Sift in {flour}, {baking soda}, {salt}, and {cinnamon}, and use a wooden spoon to mix until just combined. Don't overmix.
4. Transfer the batter to your prepared pan, and top with extra {banana} slices.
5. Bake for about 45 minutes, then cover with foil and bake for 10-15 minutes longer, until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out with just a couple of crumbs.
6. Let cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely before slicing.

# Serving Suggestions

Enjoy warm with vegan butter, or toasted the next day. Delicious for breakfast with coffee or as an afternoon snack. Try spreading with peanut butter or almond butter for extra protein.
