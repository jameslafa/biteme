# Notes

Press the tofu well — at least 15 minutes with a cloth or kitchen paper — for crispier results. Fresh spinach gives a brighter colour but frozen works fine if well drained.

# Ingredients

## Fresh

- 500 g fresh spinach
- 2 medium onions, roughly chopped
- 4 cloves garlic
- 1 thumb fresh ginger
- Lemon for juice

## Fridge

- 400 g firm tofu
- 1 tin (400 ml) coconut cream

## Pantry

- 2 tbsp vegetable oil (e.g. rapeseed, sunflower, canola)

## Spices

- 2 tsp cumin seeds
- 1 tsp coriander powder
- 1 tsp garam masala
- 1/2 tsp turmeric
- 1/4 tsp nutmeg
- 1 tsp chilli flakes, adjust to taste
- Salt to taste

# Instructions

1. Press {tofu} with a cloth or kitchen paper for at least 15 minutes to remove excess moisture, then cut into 2 cm cubes.
2. Heat {oil} in a pan over high heat. Pan-fry the tofu until golden and crispy on all sides. Set aside.
3. In the same pan, fry the {cumin seeds} until they pop, then add {onions} and cook until deeply golden, about 10 minutes.
4. Add {garlic} and {ginger}, cook for 2 minutes, then add {turmeric}, {coriander powder} and {chilli flakes}. Stir well.
5. Add the {spinach} and let it wilt completely.
6. Blend everything into a smooth sauce using a hand blender.
7. Stir in the {coconut cream} and simmer for 5 minutes.
8. Add the tofu back in, season with {garam masala}, {nutmeg} and {salt}, and simmer for another 5 minutes. Finish with a squeeze of {lemon} juice.

# Serving Suggestions

Serve with basmati rice or naan. A squeeze of lemon at the end brightens it up nicely.
