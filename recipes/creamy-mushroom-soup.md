# Notes

For a deeper, more umami flavour, add a splash of dry white wine after cooking the onions and let it reduce before adding the stock. If you have dried porcini (Steinpilze), soak a small handful in warm water for 20 minutes, chop them up and add them along with their soaking liquid for incredible depth. The soup keeps well in the fridge for 3-4 days and also freezes beautifully.

# Ingredients

## Fresh
- 500 g mixed mushrooms (champignons, Kräuterseitlinge, Shiitake), sliced
- 1 medium onion, diced
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 medium floury potato (about 150 g), peeled and cubed
- 1 tsp fresh thyme (or 1/2 tsp dried)
- Lemon for juice
- Fresh parsley for garnish

## Fridge
- 200 ml oat cream (Hafer Cuisine)

## Pantry
- 750 ml vegetable stock
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 1 tbsp soy sauce

## Spices
- Salt and pepper to taste

# Instructions

1. Heat {olive oil} in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add {mushrooms} and cook for about 8 minutes until they've released their liquid and turned golden brown. Set aside a small handful for garnish if you like.
2. Lower the heat to medium, add a little more oil if needed, and cook {onion} for about 5 minutes until soft and translucent.
3. Add {garlic} and {thyme}, stir for about a minute until fragrant.
4. Add {potato} cubes and {vegetable stock}. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer and cook for about 15 minutes, until the potato is completely tender.
5. Stir in {oat cream} and {soy sauce}.
6. Blend the soup using a stick blender until smooth and creamy. If you set some {mushrooms} aside earlier, stir them back in now for a bit of texture.
7. Season with {salt}, {pepper}, and a squeeze of {lemon} juice. The lemon really lifts the flavour.
8. Serve with fresh {parsley} on top and some crusty bread on the side.

# Serving Suggestions

Serve with crusty bread for dipping. Add a swirl of extra oat cream and a drizzle of truffle oil for a fancy touch. Great with a side salad for a complete meal.
