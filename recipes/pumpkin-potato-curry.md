# Notes

If you like a bit of heat, add a chopped chilli or some chilli flakes in step 2. A handful of spinach stirred in at the end is a nice addition. Keeps well in the fridge for 3–4 days and actually tastes even better the next day!

# Ingredients

## Fresh Produce
- 500g pumpkin, peeled and cubed
- 500g floury potatoes, peeled and cubed
- 1 onion, diced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- Thumb-sized piece of ginger, grated
- Fresh coriander to serve
- Lime to serve

## Refrigerated Items
- 1 tin (400ml) coconut milk

## Pantry
- 200ml vegetable stock
- 2 tbsp curry paste (red or yellow)

## Spices
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- 1 tsp ground turmeric
- Salt and pepper to taste

## Oils & Condiments
- 1 tbsp vegetable oil

# Instructions

1. Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add onion and cook for about 5 minutes until soft.
2. Add garlic, ginger, curry paste, cumin, and turmeric. Stir and cook for another minute until fragrant.
3. Add pumpkin and potato cubes and stir everything together so they're coated in the spices.
4. Pour in coconut milk and vegetable stock. Give it a good stir and bring to a gentle boil.
5. Reduce the heat, cover, and let it simmer for about 20–25 minutes, stirring occasionally, until both the pumpkin and potatoes are tender. The floury potatoes will start to break down and thicken the sauce beautifully.
6. Season with salt and pepper, then serve over rice (or with naan) topped with fresh coriander and a squeeze of lime.

# Serving Suggestions

Serve over basmati rice or with warm naan bread. Top with fresh coriander and a squeeze of lime. Great for meal prep – portion into containers for easy weeknight dinners throughout the week.
