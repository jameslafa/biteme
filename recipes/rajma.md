# Notes

Don't rush the onions — cooking them until deep golden brown is key to the richness of the dish. Like most curries, this one is even better the next day once the flavours have had time to develop.

# Ingredients

## Fresh

- 2 medium onions, finely diced
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 thumb fresh ginger, grated
- Fresh coriander to finish

## Pantry

- 2 tins (400 g each) red kidney beans, drained and rinsed
- 1 tin (400 g) chopped tomatoes
- 1 tbsp tomato purée
- 250 ml vegetable stock
- 1 tbsp vegetable oil (e.g. rapeseed, sunflower, canola)

## Spices

- 1 tsp cumin seeds
- 1 tsp coriander powder
- 1 tsp garam masala
- 1 tsp smoked paprika
- 1/2 tsp turmeric
- 1/2 tsp chilli powder, adjust to taste
- Salt to taste

# Instructions

1. Heat {oil} in a heavy-bottomed pan and fry the {cumin seeds} until they pop.
2. Add the {onions} and cook on medium heat for 12–15 minutes until deep golden brown.
3. Add {garlic} and {ginger}, cook for 2 minutes.
4. Add {turmeric}, {coriander powder}, {smoked paprika}, {chilli powder} and {tomato purée}. Stir well and cook for 2 minutes.
5. Add the {tomatoes} and cook for 8–10 minutes until the sauce thickens and the oil starts to separate slightly.
6. Add the {kidney beans} and {vegetable stock}, stir well, cover and simmer on low heat for 20–25 minutes.
7. Lightly mash a few beans with the back of a spoon to thicken the sauce further.
8. Season with {salt}, finish with {garam masala} and fresh {fresh coriander}.

# Serving Suggestions

Serve with basmati rice. A squeeze of lemon and a dollop of coconut yoghurt work well on top.
