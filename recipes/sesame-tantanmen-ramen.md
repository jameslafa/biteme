# Notes

Tantanmen is the Japanese take on Sichuan dan dan noodles. The key is the sesame paste — use Asian sesame paste (not tahini), which is made from toasted seeds and has a much deeper flavour. If you can't find rayu (Japanese chilli oil), any chilli oil works. Press the tofu well before crumbling for crispier results.

# Ingredients

## Fresh

- 1/4 small cabbage, shredded
- 100 g bean sprouts
- 2 spring onions, sliced
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1 tsp fresh ginger, minced

## Fridge

- 200 g firm tofu, drained and crumbled
- 250 ml soy milk
- 1/2 tbsp miso paste

## Pantry

- 2 portions ramen noodles
- 3 tbsp Asian sesame paste
- 2 tbsp soy sauce
- 1/2 tbsp rice vinegar
- 1 tbsp sesame oil
- 1 tsp rayu (Japanese-style)
- 300 ml vegetable stock
- 80 g sweetcorn
- Crushed peanuts to serve

## Spices

- 1 tsp chilli oil
- Sesame seeds to serve

# Instructions

1. Heat a drizzle of {sesame oil} in a skillet over medium heat. Add {garlic} and {ginger}, stir for 30 seconds until fragrant.
2. Add the crumbled {tofu}, {soy sauce} (1/2 tbsp), {miso paste}, and {chilli oil}. Fry for 3 to 5 minutes, stirring often, until the tofu is golden and crispy. Set aside.
3. Steam or blanch the {cabbage} and {bean sprouts} for about 3 minutes until just tender. Set aside.
4. In a small bowl, mix the {sesame paste}, remaining {soy sauce} (1 1/2 tbsp), {rice vinegar}, 1 tsp {sesame oil}, and {rayu} into a smooth paste.
5. In a saucepan, heat the {soy milk} and {vegetable stock} over medium-low heat. When it starts to bubble, reduce the heat to low and whisk in the sesame paste mixture until fully dissolved.
6. Cook the {ramen noodles} according to the package instructions. Drain and divide between two bowls.
7. Pour the hot broth over the noodles. Top with the spicy tofu crumbles, steamed vegetables, {sweetcorn}, {spring onions}, {crushed peanuts}, and {sesame seeds}. Finish with extra {rayu} to taste.

# Serving Suggestions

Serve immediately while piping hot. For extra heat, add more rayu or a drizzle of chilli oil on top. A squeeze of lime on the side is a nice addition. If you want a richer broth, stir in an extra tablespoon of sesame paste.
