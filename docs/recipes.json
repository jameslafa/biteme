    "notes": "The resting time is important. It lets the flour fully hydrate and the gluten relax, which makes the crêpes easier to spread thinly and less likely to tear. The first crêpe is almost always a disaster. Consider it a test run and adjust the heat accordingly. La première est pour le chien! Corn starch will give slightly crispier crêpes, potato starch will give softer, more flexible ones.",
